# NFC and Android

My main programming language is Java and mostly I've worked on the backend. If there's any exposure to the frontend it would be web front end development using Java frameworks. So it's not really a difficult transition to develop against Android devices. However, it does not mean that it's any easier. In fact, smaller devices have much more challenges especially with the fragmentation of the devices in the Android world.

But what really got me into Android programming is less the interest for developing mobile applications than the technology behind NFC and its potentials. At its core there's nothing really fancy with NFC. But there is the facination with activating and exchanging information with a chip which just animates whenever it becomes close to a NFC radio. 

For some this hardly is surprising anymore. It’s a technology which had become pervasive in our lives. It’s there when we use our proximity cards to secure our offices and homes. It’s there when we use contactless credit cards that allow contactless payments. It’s also there in our passports ubiquituously sharing our intimate information to foreign govenrments.
 
But what catches my interest in this 80’s technology is that some guys had the marvelous idea of putting NFC radios into Android phones (iPhone units as well but so far Apple seems less interested in exposing it to external developers). Moreover, it’s a powered radio thus it can emulate as well as act as NFC terminals. Because of this, we can basically shrink all our proximity cards, credit cards, and even our passports into the Android phone.

The marriage between these two technologies is the great innovation which holds promise. I think NFC will connect the virtual world back to the physical world. I’m currently trying out an idea of sending over “authorization” over the Android phones which can be actualised by the NFC radio. So I’m definitely tuned in to how the marriage between these two technologies will turn out in the years to come.
